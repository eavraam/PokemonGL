## General info
An implementation of a Pokemon-like game in OpenGL using C++ for a university semester project. The purpose of this project was to get a hands-on experience on graphics programming, outlining its  most important aspects. Having no prior experience on graphics programming or C++, I took the learning approach of learnopengl.com to get acquainted with the basics, and then step on these foundations to get creative.

The project simulates a character moving inside a bordered-by-trees environment (just like Pokemon games usually do), in a third-person perspective. The character is able to throw/use Pokeballs, which make a Pokemon appear after colliding with the environment, while also being able to recapture them.

Note: The project might have been delivered, but it is not over yet. When time allows it, I will update it with other important aspects of graphics programming, like: Particle system (to simulate Pokemon attacks), VFX for when the Pokemon appear or are recaptured, and other aesthetic upgrades.
